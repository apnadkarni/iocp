 * An IocpBuffer is used to queue I/O requests and pass data between

 * also a data area that holds the actual I/O bytes.
 *
 * As such, the IocpBuffer may be referenced from one of the following
 * contexts:
 *   * the Tcl thread via the IocpChannel structure,
 *   * the Windows kernel within the overlapped I/O execution, and
 *   * the completion thread after the I/O completes
 *
 * Key point to note: it is only accessed from one context at a time and
 * there is **no need for explicit locking of the structure**. When a
 * IocpBuffer is allocated, it is only accessible from the allocating
 * thread. Once passed to the Win32 I/O routines, it is only accessed from
 * the kernel. The Tcl and IOCP completion thread do not access and in fact
 * do not even hold a pointer to it. When the I/O call completes, it is
 * retrieved by the completion thread at which point that is the only thread
 * that has access to it. Finally, the completion thread either frees the
 * buffer or enqueues to the channel input queue under the channel lock
 * after which point it is only accessed from the Tcl thread owning the
 * channel under the control of the channel lock. Then the cycle
 * (potentially) repeats. Since only one thread at any point has access to
 * it, there is no need for a lock.
 *
 * For the same reason, there is no reason for a reference count. Only one
 * component holds a reference to it at a time:
 * - the Tcl thread on initial allocation
 * - the Win32 I/O calls (which never free it)
 * - the completion thread
 * - the IocpChannel input queue
 * It is up to the currently owning component to either free the buffer or hand
 * it off to the next component.

/*
 * IocpChannel contains the generic portion of Tcl IOCP channels that is
 * common to all IocpChannel implementations. Its primary purpose is to
 * encapsulate state and functions common to all IOCP channel types including
 *  - state pertaining to Tcl's channel layer.
 *  - functions interfacing to the IOCP threads
 *  - buffer queueing
 * The structures holding state for the concrete IOCP channel types inherit
 * from this structure (by inclusion).
 *
 * General working and lifetime:
 *
 * - A IocpChannel is allocated through the socket (or similar) call. It
 *   starts with a reference count of 1 corresponding to the reference from
 *   the Tcl channel subsystem. The corresponding reference decrement will
 *   happen when the channel is closed through IocpCloseProc.
 *
 * - The Tcl channel layer then calls the IocpThreadActionProc function
 *   which attaches it to a thread. The thread id as well as a pointer to
 *   the thread specific data (which houses the ready queue) is stored in
 *   the IocpChannel. The completion thread uses these to send notifications
 *   to the appropriate channel.
 *
 * - For I/O, IocpBuffer's are allocated and posted to the Win32 I/O API.
 *   The IocpBuffer points back to the associated IocpChannel and thus
 *   increments the latter's reference count. The corresponding reference
 *   decrement happens when the IocpBuffer is freed.
 *
 * - When a read I/O completes, the IOCP completion thread retrieves the
 *   IocpBuffer and places it on the IocpChannel's inputBuffers queue.
 *   (Write I/O are simpler but work similarly and not described here.)
 *
 * - The completion thread then adds an entry to the channel ready queue
 *   for that thread (via the channel's thread data pointer) and alerts
 *   the owning thread. The IocpChannel's reference count is incremented
 *   corresponding to this reference. As an optimization, the channel
 *   is not queued if already on the ready queue for that thread. The
 *   readyQThread field is used for this purpose.
 *
 * - When the Tcl thread event loop invokes the event source check function
 *   for the channel type, all ready queue entries are popped from the
 *   ready queue and processed. A Tcl event is generated for the channel
 *   and queued. In the normal case, the reference count for the channel is
 *   unchanged since the logical decrement for popping from ready queue and
 *   a logical increment for placing on event queue cancel each other.
 *
 * - The notified Tcl thread receives the event and processes the
 *   completion invoking any file event callbacks via Tcl_NotifyChannel if
 *   necessary. The IocpChannel reference count is decremented as it is no
 *   longer referenced from the Tcl event queue.
 *
 * - The IocpBuffer's on the IocpChannel inputBuffers queue are processed
 *   when the Tcl channel layer calls IocpInputProc to read data.
 *
 * - Before closing the Tcl channel layer calls the IocpThreadActionProc to
 *   detach the channel. This marks the channel as unowned and removes the
 *   the reference to the owning thread's thread data.
 *
 * - On the actual close, the IocpCloseProc function is called which
 *   decrements the IocpChannel reference count corresponding to the initial
 *   allocation reference. NOTE this does not mean the IocpChannel structure
 *   itself is freed since its reference count may not have reached 0 due to
 *   existing references from IocpBuffer's queued for I/O. When those
 *   buffers complete, they will be freed at which point the IocpChannel
 *   reference count will also drop to 0 resulting in it being freed.
 *
 * For blocked operations, e.g. a blocking connect or read, the Tcl thread
 * will wait on the IocpChannel.cv condition variable which will be
 * triggered by the I/O completion thread when the operation completes.
 *
 * Access to the structure is synchronized through the
 * IocpChannelLock/IocpChannelUnlock functions.
